Voytsje Haxe Unit
================================================================================

A fork of haxe.unit. Haxe unit has been removed in Haxe 4. It is the simplest
unit testing framework to get started with in Haxe.

This fork has a few improvements compared to the original. A few assertions were
added and it is now possible to specify a custom error message for all
assertions.

This can make it a lot easier to figure out why specific tests failed.
